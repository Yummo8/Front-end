# Contributing to [Bomb.money](https://bomb.money)

ðŸŽ‰ First off all, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

Following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the `Bomb.money` website. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

We take our open source community seriously and hold ourselves and other contributors to high standards of communication. By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct).

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the website, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. Make sure to collect and provide as much information as possible for us to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help by indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

### Pull Requests

PRs to our ecosystem are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement included for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation in the pull request to describe how you solved the issue.

For major changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962)

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Push changes to your fork
6. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.

### Submitting changes

Always open a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our coding requirements (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
